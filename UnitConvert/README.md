While the standard unit of measurement for mass is the kilogram, many different units exist for measuring mass (and weight). Create a function called convert_mass that has three parameters: "value" - the number for the current mass, "current"- the unit currently used for the mass, and "target" -  the unit to convert the mass into. The function should return the number for the current mass expressed in the target unit. Use the following conversion tables for the possible current and target units.
