In the United States, when eating at a restaurant, it is customary to "tip" the wait staff based upon the value of the food and drinks ordered.  Additionally, local and state governments may also tax the customer as well.  

For this programming assignment, write a  Python script that computes and prints out part of the bill/receipt that is provided to customers.
 

That prints the following:

Subtotal: $     10.00  
     Tax: $      0.50  
     Tip: $      2.00  
           ==========  
   Total: $     12.50  
with the call: print_receipt(10.00, .05, .2)
