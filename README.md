This repository contains two projects: Election Results Processing and Retirement Calculator, and other tasks solved by Python.

## Election Results Processing Project

This program is designed to process "election results" data, including state information and vote results. It performs several steps to analyze and report the election outcome.

### Project Overview

In this project, a program is written to process election results, focusing on the following key tasks:

1. Load and process a state information file.
2. Print state information.
3. Load and process the vote information file.
4. Determine the election winner and print the result.
5. Identify states that require a recount and save recount information to a file.
6. Determine in which state candidate A had the largest win and print the result.

## Retirement Calculator Project

This project is designed to help users plan for their retirement by calculating the cumulative investment for different investment strategies. It reads historical data, calculates rates of return, and outputs the results to a file for each of the three investment strategies.

### Project Overview

In this project, a retirement calculator program will be implemented. The program's main objectives are as follows:

1. Load and process historical data for S&P 500 index levels and US government bond rates.
2. Calculate the rates of return for both the S&P 500 and US government bonds.
3. Calculate the cumulative investment for three different investment strategies.
4. Write the results to a file in CSV format.

## Other tasks
There are some basic tasks programmed with Python.
